# 🌐 Network Communication System – SPL3

A multi-language communication system featuring a **Java-based server** and a **C++ client**, designed for efficient, and concurrent messaging across channels. This project was built as part of a university assignment to explore real-time systems and advanced concurrency models.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Java** – for building the backend server  
- **C++** – for implementing the client-side application  
- **Thread-Per-Client Model** – basic concurrent handling of multiple clients  
- **Reactor Pattern** – high-performance, non-blocking event-driven server model  

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Channel-based messaging system  
- Client-server architecture  
- Multi-threaded design  
- Event loop and reactor-based concurrency  
- Manual memory management and C++ proficiency
